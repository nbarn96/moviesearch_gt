This is a simple movie application for CS 4440. While there are a lot of files in this repository,
only the files in these folders should be modified in any way:

# /app
This is where the application lives. Edits should not be made to any file outside of this folder!

# /app/static
This is for CSS and JavaScript files, along with any images that aren't part of a listing in the database.

# /app/templates
This is for HTML files.

# routes.py
This is for the Python functions and methods that power the application.
